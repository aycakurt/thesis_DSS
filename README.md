# Thesis Data Science & Society

## Why?
This repository is a way to share my code for my Master's thesis regarding the lexical diversity of human-written and ChatGPT-generated answers. Additionally, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms (Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Naive Bayes (NB)) and a Deep Learning (DL) model (DistilBERT) are used for AI-generated text detection. 

## Structure
- lexical_diversity.ipynb contains the code for the analysis regarding the lexical diversity.
- statistical_analysis.ipynb contains the code for the statistical analysis.
- ml_algorithms.ipynb contains the code for the detection of AI-generated text, specifically for the ML algorithms (LR, SVM, DT, NB).
- distilbert.ipynb contains the code for the detection of AI-generated text using DistilBERT.
