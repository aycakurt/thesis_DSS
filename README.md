# Why?
This repository is a way to share my code for my Master's thesis regarding the lexical diversity of human-written and ChatGPT-generated answers. Additionally, Machine Learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes) and a Deep Learning model (DistilBERT) are used for AI-generated text detection. 

## Structure
- lexical_diversity.ipynb contains the code for the linguistic analysis
